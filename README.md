# Minishell

An interesting group project for 2 people. The goal of this project is to create a simple shell that will serve as our own small bash.

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Command Line Parsing**: Handled by my teammate.
   
2. **Execution**: My part.
   
3. **Builtins**: My part.

How to use it : ./minishell *"commande-line"*
